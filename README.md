# Zod Implementation

This is a mini implementation of the Zod library for dynamic type checking in TypeScript. The library provides a simple way to define schemas for objects and validate them against these schemas, focusing on primitive types such as string, number, and boolean.

## Features

- Define object schemas using `z.object()`
- Validate objects against defined schemas using `safeParse()`
- Collects all type errors in validation results

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pankaj2612/Zod-Implementation.git
cd Zod-Implementation
